This is a scheduler im calling the backpack buddy that basically should tell u how much time you have left in class with interactive buttons and stuff. i may add grade checking later, who knows. built on a pi zero wh and with https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.44inch_LCD_HAT.

most of this is default files rn, but i made main.py, schedule config stuff, and the whole project was my idea.
